        "This tutorial shows how to train a sentiment classifer on the IMDB dataset using learned word embeddings. As a bonus, we show how to visualize these embeddings in the [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org). \n",
        "\n",
        "First, here's a bit of background. Before we can build a model to predict the sentiment of a review, first we will need a way to represent the words of the review as numbers, so they can be processed by our network. There are several strategies to convert words to numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a first attempt, we might one-hot encode each word. One problem with this approach is efficiency. A one-hot encoded vector is sparse (meaning, most indicices are zero). Imagine we have 10,000 words in our vocabulary. To one-hot encode each one, we would create a vector where 99.99% of the elements are zero!\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, we can encode each word using a unique number. For example, we might assign 1 to 'the', 42 to 'dog', and 96 to 'cat', and so on. Using these numbers, we could encode a sentence like \"The dog and cat sat on the mat\" as \\[1, 42, 96, ...\\]. One problem still remains. Although we know dogs and cats are related, our representation doesn't encode that information for the classifier (the numbers 42 and 96 were arbitrarily chosen). \n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike the above methods, a word embedding is learned from data. An embedding represents each word as a n-dimensional vector of floating point values. These values are traininable parameters, weights learned while training the model. After training, we hope that similar words will be close together in the embedding space. We can visualize the learned embeddings by projecting them down to a 2- or 3-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two ways to obtain word embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Learn word embeddings jointly with the main task you care about (e.g. sentiment classification). In this case, you would start with random word vectors, then learn your word vectors in the same way that you learn the weights of a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Load word embeddings into your model that were pre-computed using a different machine learning task than the one you are trying to solve. These are called \"pre-trained word embeddings\".\n",
        "\n",
